# shiny_react
It's an POC for combining React on frontend with R Shiny on backend.
Its still an early stage of the application (without sufficient testing yet) but you may already see the demo on:
https://vsc.filpro.io/

React is communicating with Shiny through websocket and REST API (Shiny is capable of exposing session scoped REST API). 
Thanks to that client may easily call for data, as well as server can push information to the client. 

This Readme will be extended with further details regarding configuration and deployment options. .

Hope you will find it useful.
